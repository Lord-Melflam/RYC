# Moderation Guidelines - RYC (Rate Your Courses)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2026

## Purpose

RYC's moderation system ensures that course reviews are:
- Honest and helpful
- Respectful and constructive
- Free from spam and abuse
- Valuable for future students

## Layered Moderation Approach

RYC uses a multi-layered moderation system that balances automation, community involvement, and human oversight.

### Layer 1: Automated Filtering

All submitted reviews automatically go through:

1. **Content Validation**
   - Required fields check (rating, difficulty, workload)
   - Character limits enforcement
   - Format validation

2. **Spam Detection**
   - Duplicate content detection
   - Rate limiting enforcement
   - Suspicious pattern detection

3. **Initial Status**: All reviews start as `PENDING`

### Layer 2: Community Moderation

Users play a crucial role in maintaining quality:

1. **Flagging System**
   - Any user can flag a review
   - Must provide a reason
   - Flagging is anonymous

2. **Flag Thresholds**
   - 1 flag: Review marked for monitoring
   - 3+ flags: Review status changes to `FLAGGED`
   - Automatic escalation to manual review

3. **Flag Reasons**
   - Spam or promotional content
   - Offensive language or personal attacks
   - Misleading or false information
   - Duplicate content
   - Off-topic content
   - Other (with explanation)

### Layer 3: Manual Review

Human moderators review:
- Flagged content
- Randomly sampled reviews (quality assurance)
- Appeals (future feature)

## Review Status States

### PENDING
- **Definition**: Newly submitted review awaiting approval
- **Visibility**: Not visible to public
- **Next Steps**: Automated checks → Community feedback → Approval or rejection

### APPROVED
- **Definition**: Review meets quality standards
- **Visibility**: Public, visible to all users
- **Can Change**: Yes, if flagged by community

### FLAGGED
- **Definition**: Community has raised concerns (3+ flags)
- **Visibility**: Hidden from public pending review
- **Next Steps**: Manual moderator review

### REJECTED
- **Definition**: Review violates guidelines
- **Visibility**: Permanently hidden
- **Next Steps**: None (not published)

## Content Guidelines

### Decision Framework

When reviewing flagged content, ask:

   - Does it pertain to the course?
   - Is it helpful for future students?

2. **Is it respectful?**
   - Constructive criticism vs. personal attack?
   - Professional language?

3. **Is it honest?**
   - Appears genuine?
   - Based on real experience?

4. **Is it appropriate?**
   - Follows content guidelines?
   - No violations?

### Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Negative Review
**Content**: "Worst course ever. Professor is terrible."  
**Decision**: ❌ REJECT  
**Reason**: Too vague, not constructive, borderline personal attack

**Better Version**: "Found the course challenging. Would benefit from clearer explanations and more examples."

#### Scenario 2: Detailed Criticism
**Content**: "Course material is outdated. Lectures don't align with assignments. Time management is difficult. Heavy workload without clear objectives."  
**Decision**: ✅ APPROVE  
**Reason**: Specific, constructive, helpful feedback

#### Scenario 3: Borderline Language
**Content**: "This course sucks but the professor tries hard."  
**Decision**: Consider context
- Minor language issue
- Otherwise constructive
- Action: May approve with note

#### Scenario 4: Spam
**Content**: "Check out my tutoring service at example.com!"  
**Decision**: ❌ REJECT  
**Reason**: Clear spam/promotion
